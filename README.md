This is my GitHub Pages website, you can get to it at:

[gavJackson.github.io](http://gavJackson.github.io)

This repository contains the code for LM Barrett's website, which no longer exists on http://www.lmbarrett-author.com/

I plan to move this code into a sub folder and use this site for http://www.digital-mojo.com/


Jekyll
-----

run `sudo bundle install` in the new directory and finally `bundle exec jekyll serve`. You can now access your brand-new Jekyll site on http://127.0.0.1:4000/. Enjoy!

Gotchas
----
The background image `bg.jpg` must be 1680x2000 or weirdness may ensue.


About the micro site in the sophie folder
----

This website is an attempt to provide Single Page Application style experience with as little JavaScript code as possible.

Most of the clever bits are done using CSS and native browser features like `position:sticky` - there is a rudamentary router implementation in JavaScript and some clever loading stuff and thats about it.

The idea is that by keeping this site as simple as possible, it will be more accessible to SEO robots.  It's fully functional even if you turn JavaScript off in your browser!

About the author
----

A Reflection of Sophie Beaumont is the debut novel by L M Barrett. After living in Bristol, England for ten years, she now lives in Javea, Spain with her husband and two children. Lorraine always wanted to write a book, but office jobs got in the way so she was finally able to give it a go, once living in Spain. She enjoyed it immensely, especially writing about such a flawed character like Sophie and hopes to be able to follow it up with more books in the near future. Lorraine enjoys reading, hanging out with the kids, learning Spanish and skiing.
