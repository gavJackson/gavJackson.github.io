## About

Fun, selfless and beautiful - well, that’s what Louisa Johnson thinks about herself. Her family is less inclined to agree. Annoying, pushy and completely spoilt are other descriptions that spring to mind.

But what happens when your children aren’t grateful for all the interference...ahem, help and guidance over the years? What happens when even her long-suffering husband’s had enough of his demanding, high-maintenance wife?

When secrets finally come back to haunt her and her not so perfect life is thrown into chaos, will the reigning queen of melodrama make things right before they go oh so wrong? Or is this the perfect opportunity to relive all those wasted years stuck at home as an underappreciated mother and housewife?

Follow Louisa’s emotional rollercoaster of a life as she contends with disgruntled family members, a strange obsession with an 80’s pop star, and a hilarious encounter with a dose of reality when she least expects it.

### What readers are saying;

> A hilarious page turner, fans of Four Weddings and a Funderal or Love Actually would enjoy this story spanning thirty years from young mum to grown up children. Louise is a great central character in this heart warming rom com novel.
