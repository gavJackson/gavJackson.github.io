## About

For fans of Sophie Ranald, Fiona Gibson and Mhairi McFarlane.

Dating hasn't always turned out well for Lucy and her latest prospect isn't any different when this 'perfect' man turns out to be...well, rather charmless. Not that she cares, but for some reason Lucy always seems to be making a fool of herself infront of this jerk when they keep bumping into each other.

But what happens when he helps her out of a sticky situation? Maybe this charmless man isn't as charmless as she first thought?
Could he possibly be attracted to her?

And just when Lucy starts getting her life on track, her career explodes and takes her to unexpected places and notoriety. Please don't mention knickergate! Can the two misfits ever get together or have they both blown it before it begins?

Read now in this fun, sweet, romantic comedy.
