## About

You can take the girl out of the city but can you take the city out of the girl?

When trekking in the Amazon rainforest, most normal people must overcome their fears of the unknown. For city girl Grace Brooks, she must overcome her fears of no makeup and going to the loo. And can she survive two weeks without a hairdryer?

When Grace is offered the chance of a lifetime - to test out brand new camping equipment in the rainforest - it’s easy to turn down. After all, who in their right mind wants to trek around the muddy rainforest? But when the offer becomes too good to be true and friends and family doubt her ability, she’s determined to prove them wrong.

And who knows - there’s always the chance of love when it’s just her and a hunky Brazilian guide. Except, he’s not quite what she expects and when she becomes hopelessly lost, life becomes a little tricky.

When Patrick Kirk’s holiday is interrupted to complete the most absurd mission of his life - to rescue some bimbo lost in the rainforest - he’s determined to despise the silly woman. But as he closes in on her and thanks to his new tech, he catches transmissions of her daily diary recordings. Recordings she has no idea are being aired. As she talks about life, death and feelings, he finds himself drawn to the woman - especially when she announces her intention to sleep with the first man she sees.

When he finally catches up with her, Grace is less than impressed with her neanderthal rescuer. Patrick too, is less than impressed with the high-maintenance whiner.

Stuck together for at least a week, can they learn to get on or are they destined to kill each other?
