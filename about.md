## About Lorraine

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/lorraine.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

A Reflection of Sophie Beaumont is the debut novel by Lorraine Barrett.

She would like to stress that it is a work of fiction and no characters are based on anyone in her real life. Like Sophie, she grew up in Birmingham, lived in Bristol and both have dark hair (and an aversion to work!) but that is where the similarities end.

### Location is Important
<div class="box">
  <p>
    Lorraine lives and writes from JÃ¡vea, a small seaside town on the beautiful Costa Blanca in Spain. A Reflection of Sophie Beaumont was written shortly after Lorraine, her husband and two young children moved to Spain after spending ten years living and working in Bristol, having never previously written anything - so perhaps the climate and beautiful surroundings are conducive to the writing process, it certainly helped Lorraine!
