title: LM Barrett - Author
description: Lorraine lives and writes from JÃ¡vea, a small seaside town on the beautiful Costa Blanca in Spain. A Reflection of Sophie Beaumont was written shortly after Lorraine, her husband and two young children moved to Spain after spending ten years living and working in Bristol, having never previously written anything - so perhaps the climate and beautiful surroundings are conducive to the writing process, it certainly helped Lorraine!

									<h2>Welcome to Lorraine's writing</h2>
									<p>L M Barrett is a British writer currently living in Spain with her husband and two children. She doesn't believe in the Oxford comma but is happy to begin a sentence with a conjunction.
										Pretend hobbies are skiing, cycling, swimming and learning Spanish. Real hobbies are looking at a laptop screen all day and enjoying the views from the local beach with a glass (or three) of the cheap, local red wine in the evening.
										Her stories are all highly entertaining and fast-paced. So please take a look at them. For her third book, she resisted the urge to turn any of her characters into sociopaths. Future books may revert back to a sociopath but who knows?
